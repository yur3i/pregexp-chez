= pregexp

*This version is modified to support Chez scheme, it may not work with other dialects of Scheme*

pregexp is a portable implementation of regular expressions
(regexps) that runs in any R5RS- or R4RS-compliant implementation
of the programming language Scheme, and in Common Lisp.  The regexp
notation supported is compatible with Perl’s, and includes such
powerful directives as

- numeric quantifiers
- non-greedy quantifiers
- POSIX character classes
- non-capturing clusters (in addition to the usual capturing kind)
- selective (i.e., per-cluster) case-insensitivity
- selective space-insensitivity (with provision for comments)
- backreferences
- alternation
- backtrack pruning
- lookahead (positive and negative)
- lookbehind (positive and negative)

This is in addition to the more basic directives
familiar to all regexp users.

== For Scheme

Simply load the file `pregexp.scm` into your Scheme.
Alternatively, if your dialect allows it, you can install pregexp
as a module — consult the file
link:INSTALL.adoc[].

However you load pregexp, you will now have access to the
procedures

- `pregexp`
- `pregexp-match-positions`
- `pregexp-match`
- `pregexp-split`
- `pregexp-replace`
- `pregexp-replace*`

The use of these procedures is described fully and with examples
in the pregexp manual.

== For Common Lisp

`pregexp.lisp` is a Common Lisp implementation of the same
routines as in `pregexp.scm`, with the same behavior (modulo
transparent stuff like `nil` being the CL equivalent of `#f`).
